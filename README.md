### Hello, stranger :smile_cat:!

I'm a brazilian Production Engineer :office: (or industrial engineer, depending where you're reading this from) who has recently started in the field of web development. :warning: Still learning how to use GitHub properly!

#### I started writing all the READMEs in Portuguese, so it'll be a little while til I translate them to English :sweat_smile: but the new ones are coming in English! :raised_hands:

#### Oh, and I started this GitHub a while after I had already started my Web Development classes, so I've uploaded (almost) all I had late and now I'm gradually documenting.
